# oszi1994

Turbo Pascal code from 1994-1997 implementing a soundcard oscilloscope and a spectrogram FFT display.

This code is not in a runnable state, as you would need to add the protimer and fastgraf TPUs from the Multijoy project (availablel elsewhere).

I did not bother to get it run in Dosbox, as it relies on a Soundblaster microphone input as sampler, and Dosbox does not try 
to emulate that, so the only feasible place to run this would be retro-hardware.
